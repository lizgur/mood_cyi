                MOOD is more than a T-shirt â€” it's a digital statement. Born at the intersection of blockchain culture, streetwear, and raw self-expression, MOOD lets you code your identity and wear what you believe in. Each design draws from real moments in crypto history â€” from the Genesis block to Bitcoin Pizza Day â€” blending tech lore with bold, street-inspired visuals. We're inspired by code, crypto, and the rebels rewriting the rules. When you wear MOOD, you're not just putting on a shirt â€” you're broadcasting values like freedom, transparency, and a touch of chaos. Join the movement. Wear your code. Be MOOD.

              <p className="mt-4 text-text-light leading-7">
                ðŸŸ¡ Built with Love for the Chain: This isn't just a brand â€” it's my way of sharing a real passion for crypto, decentralization, and digital freedom. Every design is rooted in blockchain history and made to spark conversation. <br/><br/> ðŸŸ£ Designed to Mean Something: No random graphics. Each piece references real moments, ideas, and ethos from the Web3 world. <br/><br/> ðŸŸ¡ Limited Drops, Like Rare Tokens: We don't do mass production. Every drop is limited â€” unique like the block it was minted in. <br/><br/> ðŸŸ£ Made for the Community: MOOD was built by someone deep in the space â€” and it shows. We design for the people building the future. <br/><br/> ðŸŸ¡ Sustainable by Default: Ethically sourced materials and low-impact printing. Style shouldn't come at the planet's expense.
